# 2024 imerial AI/ML capstone

## Summary
This project is my submission for the Blackbox optimization capstone competition for 2024 Imperial College Professional Certificate in Machine Learning.

The project is a competition that requires optimization of 8 blackbox functions. We use a Bayesian optimization to solve this problem.
The code here deomstrate the solution. We will also document reflection and approaches taken.

## Inital data
We were provided with  inital observation. The directory `initial_data` contains the inital data for the submission.

## Feedback on suggestions
Subsequent feedback is in `588_data.csv`

## Running 
The optimization can be run by running the tests in `tests/test_Optimize.py`.
This will read the initial data and join this with suggestions and run the optimizer and output next suggestion.
